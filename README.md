# Description Project
## Explore the fascinating Wine dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data. This dataset includes chemical analysis of wines derived from three different cultivars grown in the same region in Italy. Our project leverages a decision tree model to classify the wines based on their chemical properties. Through this analysis, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of decision trees in wine classification and uncover patterns in the data. This project is perfect for data science enthusiasts eager to delve into classification techniques and experiment with real-world data.
