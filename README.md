# Description Project
Explore the intriguing Wine dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data. This dataset provides chemical analysis of wines derived from three different cultivars grown in the same region in Italy. Our project leverages a decision tree model to classify the wines based on their chemical properties. Through this analysis, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of decision trees in wine classification and uncover patterns in the data.

This project is part of the Digital Skill Fair (DSF) 35.0 - Data Science by Dibimbing. It's perfect for data science enthusiasts eager to delve into classification techniques and experiment with real-world data.

# Goals
1. Exploring the Wine dataset to understand the structure and basic information.
2. Building a prediction model using Decision Tree Classifier algorithm.
3. Evaluating model performance based on prediction against test data.
4. Visualizing analysis results to understand data patterns or model performance.

# Insight
1. Can identify certain patterns in the data, such as what physical characteristics are most influential in determining the type of wine.
2. Demonstrate how good the Decision Tree Classifier model at predicing wine types. Metrics such as accuracy will be used to measure the performance of the model.
3. Identify which features are most important in predicing wine types.

# Conclusion
The trained Decision Tree model was able to classify wine types with very high accuracy. These results show that Decision Tree is an effective model for wine type classification, with an accuracy 94.44%.
